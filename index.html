<h1>My Story</h1>

<body>
    <p>My name is <b>Pete Alba</b>. I grew up on the east coast but spent many years in New Orleans where I learned how
        to be a
        pro musician and eventually received a Master's in jazz performance from the <i>University of New Orleans</i>. I
        have
        performed for thousands of audiences and I have also taught guitar privately and at community colleges. As a
        code developer, I hope to use my knowledge of music to create music educational apps and other fun platforms for
        budding musicians to use.
